# Intro
Rio (spanish for river) is a library for text pre-processing, augmentation, anonymization, and synthesis. It is intended to be used to process text datasets for training NLP models. This was the original Muliwai repo but the PII code has been refactored to live in its own rep at https://www.github.com/piisa/muliwai. Howeover, Rio no longer does PII processing. Please use https://www.github.com/piisa/muliwai instead.

# How it works
We use a transformer NER model that is good enough for the current language - in this case, a specific model for the language, or a model with some cross-lingual capabilities. Rio tags using the transformer, then translates the sentence to a target_lang (e.g., English), and tests to see if the translation preserves the NER tagging, and discoutns or increases the weight of an NER decision accordingly. It then performs NER in the target_lang, and back translates to the src_lang. It then matches the translate sentence to the original sentence, to determine which text spans in the *original* src_lang sentence should be NER tagged based on the target_lang NER.

We also use spacy and regex as added signals for NER tags.

# What it's meant for
The translation techniques used are very compute heavy, and not intended to perform fast detection or anonymization of a dataset. Instead, it is intended to be used to create augmented training data to train a relatively fast model (e.g., spacy or transformer model) for languages where there is little or no NER data.

# Installing
If you want to be able to do gender detection and coref detection, you will need to load neuralcoref below. However, you will only be able to use spacy english if you load neural coref. You can also load a larger spacy model for more accuracy but more memory.
```
git clone https://github.com/ontocord/rio
pip install https://github.com/kpu/kenlm/archive/master.zip
pip install spacy==2.1.0 dateparser python-stdnum protobuf neuralcoref cdifflib transformers datasets langid faker sentencepiece fsspec tqdm sentence-transformers nltk
python -m nltk.downloader punkt wordnet
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

If you don't need gender detection and coref detection, install the below which will enable spacy for other languages. Neuralcoref will not be installed. You can also load a larger spacy model for more accuracy but more memory.
```
git clone https://github.com/ontocord/rio
pip install https://github.com/kpu/kenlm/archive/master.zip
pip install spacy==3.1.0 dateparser python-stdnum protobuf cdifflib transformers datasets langid faker sentencepiece fsspec tqdm sentence-transformers nltk tokenizers==0.11.3
python -m nltk.downloader punkt wordnet

```
 
# Running
If no filenames are passed, the sample data from turkunlp_data/{src_lang}.jsonl.gz will be loaded. The below runs on a sample of 30 documents only.
```
cd rio
python process.py -src_lang zh -cutoff 30
```
If you have more than one GPU
```
cd rio
python process.py -src_lang zh -num_workers=2 -cutoff 30
```

# Using the API

You can use the functions in regex_manager.py, ner_manager.py, and faker_manager.py to detect and anonymize PII types in text.

You can modify the regex_rulebase or pass in your own to *detect_ner_with_regex_and_context* to customize your detection. 

The following *apply_anonymization* for example will annonymize a given text in a target language. 

```
from rio.regex_manager import detect_ner_with_regex_and_context
from rio.pii_regexes_rulebase import regex_rulebase
from rio.ner_manager import detect_ner_with_hf_model
from rio.faker_manager import augment_anonymize
def apply_anonymization(
    sentence: str,
    lang_id: str,
    context_window: int = 20,
    anonymize_condition=None,
    tag_type={'IP_ADDRESS', 'KEY', 'ID', 'PHONE', 'USER', 'EMAIL', 'LICENSE_PLATE', 'PERSON'} ,
    device: str = "cpu",
) -> str:
    """
    Params:
    ==================
    sentence: str, the sentence to be anonymized
    lang_id: str, the language id of the sentence
    context_window: int, the context window size
    anonymize_condition: function, the anonymization condition
    tag_type: iterable, the tag types of the anonymization. By default: {'IP_ADDRESS', 'KEY', 'ID', 'PHONE', 'USER', 'EMAIL', 'LICENSE_PLATE', 'PERSON'} 
    device: cpu or cuda:{device_id}

    """
    if tag_type == None:
        tag_type = regex_rulebase.keys()
    lang_id = lang_id.split("_")[0]
    ner_ids = detect_ner_with_regex_and_context(
        sentence=sentence,
        src_lang=lang_id,
        context_window=context_window,
        tag_type=tag_type,
    )
    ner_persons = detect_ner_with_hf_model(
        sentence=sentence,
        src_lang=lang_id,
        device=device,
        tag_type=tag_type,
    )
    ner = list(set(ner_ids + ner_persons))
    ner.sort(key=lambda a: a[1])
    if anonymize_condition:
        new_sentence, new_ner, _ = augment_anonymize(sentence, lang_id, ner, )
        doc = {'text': new_sentence, 'ner': new_ner, 'orig_text': sentence, 'orig_ner': ner}
    else:
        new_sentence = sentence
        doc = {'text': new_sentence, 'ner': ner}
    return new_sentence, doc
    
 ```
 
# Preloading the cache
- For systems where there is limited access to the Internet, such as the JZ supercomptuers, you will want to preload the models.
- The below command will load the various models needed to run the code for the specific language. 
- The huggingface models will be stored in ~/.cache/huggingface and ~/.cache/transformers.
- The neuralcoref cache is stored in ~/.neuralcoref
- NOTE: the nlkt_data and en_core_web_sm are not stored in ~/.cache directory and will vary based on your system. See the documentation for spacy and nltk for their location.
```
cd rio
python processor.py -src_lang zh -preload_cache
